    be an asset to your organization.</p>

    as I am continuing to learn new engineering techniques everyday that are important to me.</p>

    <p>Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to 
    contribute to your bottom line are:</p>
      
    <ul>
        <li>Highly skilled in Engineering</li>
        <li>Thorough understanding of tools</li>
        <li>Knowledgeable of building design plans</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I’ve attached a copy of my resume that details my projects and experience in Engineering. I can be reached anytime
    via my cell phone, 123-456-7891 or via email at BobTheBuilder@gmail.com or BobTheBuilder@hotmail.com.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.</p>
