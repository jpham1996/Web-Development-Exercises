	<p>Dear Pokemon Trainer Cynthia:</p>
    <p>I own a degree in Master of Science in Pokemon combat, and with my academic accomplishment and job experience, I wish 
	to join you in the battle field.</p>
    
    <p>I worked with both Brock and Ash in the past, and they are both very capable pokemon trainers.  I fight for Ash in many 
	tournaments.  At one point, I helped him to to become semifinalist and runner-up.  Together with Ash, we go through a lot.  
	We also save a lot of people and Pokemons from Team Rocket, that's how good I am at fighting.  </p>

    <p>The requirements listed on your career application website closely match my background and skills. I am good at combat,  
	and I have good personality.  These are some of my traits:  </p>
      
    <ul>
        <li>Master of close quarter combat.  </li>
        <li>Master of electricity manipulation.  </li>
        <li>Work well with humans and other Pokemons.  </li>
        <li>Always beat Team Rocket.  </li>
        <li>Host tournaments before!  </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I attached my resume and contact information along with my cover letter, please look at it and reply to me ASAP.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time, I look forward to work with you.  I want you to be my new trainer.  </p>

    <p>Sincerely</p>

    <p>Pikachu</p>
