	<p>Dear Pokemon Trainer Cynthia:</p>
    <p>Ms. Champion, this is a reference letter from Pikachu's old trainer.  I am Ash Ketchum, and this is my 
	recommendation letter for both you.  I will tell you why Pikachu is the best Pokemon.  </p>
	
	<p>Both me and Pikachu admired you for a long time.  Although I was not a trainer at your caliber, I can 
	still pack a punch.  I am a champion in the Orange League, and I was placed in both semifinal and final in 
	other leagues before.  Pikachu is a big player, as he help me a lot.  </p>

	<p>Pikachu is the vanquisher of evil.  He help me to beat Team Rocket a lot.  If you see Team Rocket or 
	other villains attack you, Pikachu will always be there to protect you.  </p>
	
	<p>By all means, please give Pikachu a chance, good luck!  </p>
	
	<p></p>
    
    <p>Sincerely</p>

    <p>Ashe Ketchum</p>
