				<p> PEM's internationally renowned maritime holdings communicate personal and collective experiences of the sea during the formative times
				of the modern world. By their very nature, these works cross geographic, cultural and traditional disciplinary boundaries in ways that broaden
				perspectives, attitudes and knowledge of the individual within our world of infinite global connections.</p>

				<p> Contributions from many of America's most important 19th- and 20th-century collectors of Japanese art illuminate the varied art and culture
				of Japan. Originating with the museum's inception in 1799, the collection contains many works considered rare even in Japan, with the late Edo- 
				and Meiji-period collection ranking among the finest in the world.</p>

				<figcaption>Fig. 4 - Calling card tray, ca. 1840</figcaption>
				<p> PEM’s renowned collection of Native American art, the oldest ongoing collection in the western hemisphere, contains some of the finest works
				created over the past several centuries throughout the Americas. Works from 10,000 years ago to the present cross boundaries of region, period, 
				and medium and emphasize the continuum of creativity that has always characterized Native American art.  Through exhibitions, programming, and scholarship,
				we present Native art and culture in ways that honor the diverse worldviews, ongoing vitality, and creative continuities and expressions of artists and their
				respective cultures, worldviews, and histories. </p>

				<figcaption>Fig. 5 - Fire bucket, 1830-1840</figcaption>
				<p>  Paintings, furniture, folk art, needlework, toys and costumes represent over 300 years of New England culture. Each object reveals the values of the 
				communities that shaped this region of the early United States and ultimately informs the design and beauty of the things with which we choose to surround
				ourselves today. From art we can connect the past to the present to understand the material world around us.  Among more than 1,000 portraits is a likeness
				of Nathaniel Hawthorne that captures the author's inner spirit with a quality and immediacy that practically invites you to engage in conversation. John
				Singleton Copley's Portrait of Sarah Erving Waldo, in its original hand-carved frame, conveys the artist's ability to convincingly render details, shimmering
				fabrics and polished fine woods characteristic of the mid 18th century. </p>
