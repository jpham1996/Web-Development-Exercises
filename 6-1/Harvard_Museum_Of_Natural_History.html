				<p> New England Forests in the Zofnass Family Gallery is a multi-media exhibition that explores the natural history and ecology of our
				regional forests, their responses to human activity, and their environmental significance. Visitors are invited to explore the ecology
				of woodland caribou, wolves, and other wildlife of New England; learn about lichen cities that cling to rocks; and discover the circle
				of life within and around a forest pond, from tiny aquatic insects to giant moose.   </p>

				<p> The centerpiece of the new Marine Life exhibition—a floor-to-ceiling recreation of life in New England’s coastal waters—immerses visitors
				in the astounding diversity and dynamic interplay among animals in marine communities just off local shores. As models of glowing jellies, a
				giant sea turtle, and other sea animals appear to swim above their heads, museum goers learn about new research and explore displays of real
				fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, corals, and other marine organisms selected from the world-renowned collections of Harvard’s Museum of Comparative
				Zoology. A special interactive display introduces visitors of all ages to the amazing world of jellyfish, and the ocean exploration theater takes
				them on a multimedia journey of discovery into the surface and deep oceans of the world, guided by Harvard biologists.</p>

				<figcaption>Fig. 5 - Bees Exhibit photo</figcaption>
				<p>  Examine real specimens of bees from around the world – a surprising diversity of forms, sizes, and colors. Did you know that some bees are
				entirely stingless? Learn about their varied lives, from the solitary to super social. Look for clues in an interactive game about bee names to
				reveal the secrets of their evolution.  Watch the busy life inside a hive, look for the queen, and track worker bees as they exit and return with
				pollen baskets full from their visits to early spring blossoms. Uncover the mystery of how these tiny industrialists manufacture honey– that magical
				liquid cherished by humans for thousands of years as “Nectar of the Gods.” </p>
